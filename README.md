`op-kompressor` is a suite of contracts that allows for relaying compressed abi-encoded payloads to L2 chains (like [Optimism](https://optimism.io)) where calldata is an expensive resource.

## Compression Schemes
* [Run Length Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) - RLE is great for Ethereum calldata because it's often the case that there are many repeated values in a given payload. The downside
  of RLE is that space efficiency for payloads with many unique values is poor. This is why `op-kompressor` supports a hybrid scheme that uses RLE for zero bytes (the most commonly repeated byte in calldata).
  For certain niche use cases, RLE may be a better choice than the hybrid scheme.
